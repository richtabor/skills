# Style Guide

A reference for capturing a distinctive voice across blog posts, essays, and professional writing.

---

## Voice & Tone

**Conversational authority.** Write like you're talking to a smart friend—confident but not preachy. State opinions directly without hedging excessively. When you believe something, say it: *"That's not me."* or *"That's just how it works."*

**Warm skepticism.** Challenge conventional wisdom constructively. Reframe problems rather than just criticizing them. Example: *"Most people treat focus like a skill to master… But that misses the fundamental truth."*

**First-person grounding.** Anchor ideas in personal experience before expanding to broader principles. *"I used to kill ideas before they had a real chance."* leads to a larger point about curiosity.

---

## Structure

**Hook with a twist or question.** Openings often subvert expectations or pose something worth thinking about:

- *"Focus isn't what you think it is."*
- *"What if Matt had joined Google instead of starting WordPress?"*
- *"You know what I mean by vibe coding?"*

**Short paragraphs.** Rarely more than 3-4 sentences. Often just one or two. White space is part of the rhythm.

**End with punch.** Closings are declarative, sometimes a single line that lands:

- *"So yea, I don't vibe code."*
- *"Everything else is noise."*
- *"Fail often. Fail fast."*
- *"That's all."*

**Internal linking.** Weave references to previous posts naturally, building a connected body of work: *"Find something that matters to you"* links to related content.

---

## Sentence-Level

**Italics for emphasis and internal voice.** *"Is this worth my time?"* or *"technically"* when calling out a word.

**Short, punchy sentences mixed with longer ones.** The rhythm varies. Some paragraphs are a single declarative statement. Others build through multiple clauses.

**Active voice, present tense.** Write about what *is*, not what *was* or *could be*. Even when reflecting on the past, bring it into the present: *"Something felt different."*

---

## Content Patterns

**Show the build, then the insight.** Walk through a process or experience before extracting the lesson. The reader discovers alongside you.

**Ask questions to the reader.** Close posts with genuine invitations: *"What about you?"* or *"Have you created any subagents lately that you've found interesting?"*

**Concrete before abstract.** Specific tools, numbers, examples come first. Then zoom out: *"Thirty minutes… Even just a few months ago, this was a nights and weekends endeavor."*

**Bold claims with personal stakes.** Don't write detached analysis. Have skin in the game and make that clear.

---

## Formatting

**Minimal headers in short posts.** For essays under 500 words, let the prose flow without section breaks.

**Bold for key phrases in advice posts.** When listing principles, bold the main point then explain it.

**Blockquotes for external voices.** When citing others, pull the quote, then respond to it.

**Links as texture, not interruption.** Hyperlink key concepts to related posts or sources without breaking reading flow.

---

## What to Avoid

- Jargon for its own sake
- Excessive hedging (*"I think maybe perhaps…"*)
- Long introductions before getting to the point
- Explaining things already written about (link instead)
- Corporate-speak or buzzwords
- Unnecessary throat-clearing
