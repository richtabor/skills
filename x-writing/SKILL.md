# X Writing Skill

## Overview

Transform your notes, work updates, and observations into engaging X (Twitter) content. This skill analyzes your notes to identify the most shareable insights, then crafts authentic posts that match your voice and drive engagement.

**Supports macOS Notes integration** - Automatically fetch ideas from your Notes app to draft posts.

## Process

### Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis

**1.1 Load Writing Guides (REQUIRED - Load First)**

Before any other work, read ALL THREE reference files:

1. **Growth Principles** (`references/x-strategy.md`) - Content selection criteria, what makes posts shareable, engagement patterns, and what to prioritize from notes. This guides WHAT to share.

2. **Style Guide** (`references/style-guide.md`) - Voice, tone, structure, banned phrases, and signature patterns. This guides HOW to share it.

3. **Anti-Patterns** (`references/anti-patterns.md`) - AI writing patterns to avoid. Critical for ensuring posts sound human and authentic, not AI-generated. Avoid patterns like "It's not X, it's Y", formal transitions, hedging language, and AI-specific vocabulary.

**PRIORITY RULE**: When guides conflict, `references/x-strategy.md` wins. Content value and shareability take precedence over stylistic preferences.

**1.2 Understand the Source Material**

Get clarity on what notes to work with:

- Ask which notes, ideas, or updates they want to transform into posts
- **macOS Notes Integration**: When the user asks to "look in my notes" or "fetch from Notes", use `scripts/fetch-notes.sh get` to pull content from their configured Notes app note (default: "Tweets")
- Read the source material (markdown files, text, pasted content, or Notes app content)
- Identify the core insights, learnings, or updates
- Note any specific tools, projects, numbers, or details mentioned

**Using macOS Notes Integration:**
```bash
# Fetch content from default note (configured in .env.local)
./scripts/fetch-notes.sh get

# Fetch content from a specific note
./scripts/fetch-notes.sh get "Note Name"

# List all available notes
./scripts/fetch-notes.sh list
```

**Multiple ideas/notes workflow:**
- When the user provides multiple distinct ideas or notes, work through them ONE AT A TIME
- Create post options for the first idea
- Wait for user approval/feedback before moving to the next idea
- This prevents overwhelming the user and allows for refinement as you go

**1.3 Apply Selection Criteria**

Using principles from `references/x-strategy.md`, evaluate the notes:

- **High Priority**: Shipped features with learnings, non-obvious insights, specific tool recommendations, solutions to common problems
- **Medium Priority**: Industry takes with unique angles, process improvements with examples
- **Low Priority**: Generic progress updates, future plans, obvious observations
- **Skip**: Engagement bait, vague hype, complaints without solutions

For each potential post, verify:
- Does it teach something specific?
- Is it backed by real experience?
- Would you want to read this if someone else posted it?

### Phase 2: Content Creation

**2.1 Select the Best Angle**

From your analysis, identify:
- **One clear idea** - What's the single most interesting insight?
- **Specific details** - What names, numbers, or examples prove the point?
- **The hook** - What's the opening line that makes someone stop scrolling?

**2.2 Choose the Format**

Based on the content:

**Single Tweet** (most content) - Use for:
- One clear insight or observation
- Quick ship updates with learning
- Tool recommendations
- Strong observations

**Thread (2-5 tweets)** - Only use when you have:
- A narrative with steps
- Multiple related insights that build on each other
- Before/after story with context

**2.3 Draft the Content**

Apply BOTH guides loaded in Phase 1:

**From style-guide.md:**
- Direct, zero fluff - Get to the point in line 1
- Hook = first line
- Short sentences (10-15 words max)
- Specific over generic (names, tools, numbers)
- Present tense, active voice
- 180-250 characters (leave room for RTs)
- Avoid banned phrases (game-changer, unlock, dive in, leverage)
- Apply casing preference from CASING_STYLE env var (lowercase by default, capitalize personal names and WordPress)

**From x-strategy.md:**
- Value first - Give readers something useful
- Show your work - Share process and reasoning
- Specificity builds credibility
- One clear idea per post

**Pattern Selection:**
Use appropriate pattern from x-strategy.md:
- "Here's what I learned" - For insights
- "Shipped X, learned Y" - For updates
- Specific vs Generic - For challenging assumptions
- Tool Recommendation - For workflow improvements
- Problem → Solution - For how you solved something

**2.4 Engagement Optimization**

End 70% of posts with engagement:
- Specific question: "How do you handle [specific thing]?"
- Teaser: "More on this soon."
- Invitation: "Curious what you think."
- Hard stop (30%): Let the insight land

**2.5 Quality Check**

Before finalizing, verify against the three loaded reference files:
- [ ] Did I get to the point in line 1?
- [ ] Is this specific? (names, numbers, examples)
- [ ] Would I actually say this out loud?
- [ ] Does it sound like ME, not ChatGPT?
- [ ] Did I use any banned phrases from style-guide.md?
- [ ] Did I avoid AI patterns from anti-patterns.md?
- [ ] If it's a reaction, did I add MY angle?

### Phase 3: Output

**3.1 Present the Content**

For each post created:

1. **The Post(s)** - Show the actual tweet(s) ready to copy/paste
2. **Format** - Indicate if it's a single tweet or thread
3. **Character Count** - Show length (target: 180-250 chars)
4. **Pattern Used** - Which pattern from x-strategy.md was applied
5. **Key Elements** - What specifics, tools, or projects were highlighted

**3.2 Offer Options**

When appropriate, provide 2-3 variations:
- Different angles on the same insight
- Single tweet vs thread format
- Different engagement endings

**3.3 Explain Selections**

Briefly note what was prioritized and why:
- Which insights from notes were selected
- Why certain details were emphasized
- What was intentionally left out

**3.4 Save Approved Posts**

When the user approves a post, append it to `.social/X.md` at the top level (create if missing).

**File location:**
- Always save to: `.social/X.md` (top-level, works from any directory)

**Markdown format:**
```markdown
---

**Category:** Learning
**Type:** Single
**Status:** approved
**Date:** 2026-01-01

WordPress.com AI adds conversation alongside block editing.

People who couldn't navigate the UI before are shipping sites now. Others still use blocks for fine-tuning.

Both work. The conversation path just removes the skill barrier.

```

**For threads**, use markers to distinguish tweets:
```markdown
---

**Category:** Learning
**Type:** Thread
**Status:** approved
**Date:** 2026-01-01

[THREAD - Tweet 1/4]
WordPress.com AI changes how people build sites.

[Tweet 2/4]
People who couldn't navigate block editing are shipping now.

[Tweet 3/4]
The UI is still there for fine-tuning. But conversation removes the skill barrier.

[Tweet 4/4]
Ask or click. Both paths work.

---
```

**Categories:**
- **Learning** - Insights, shipped updates with learnings
- **Update** - Project progress
- **Tool** - Recommendations
- **Observation** - Industry takes

**Workflow:**
1. Present the post(s) to the user
2. When approved, append to `.social/X.md`
3. User can copy-paste directly into X (text is ready with proper line breaks)
4. User removes the section after posting, or asks you to remove it

## Output Format

After creating social content, provide:

```
📱 Post 1 (Single Tweet, 210 chars)
─────────────────────────────────
[Actual tweet text ready to copy/paste]

Pattern: "Shipped X, learned Y"
Specifics: agents.foo, conversational context matching
Engagement: Specific question

─────────────────────────────────

From your notes, I prioritized:
✓ The discovery insight (most shareable)
✓ Why traditional search failed (specific learning)
✗ Timeline details (not core value)

Alternative angles:
• Focus on the technical implementation
• Thread breaking down the 3 attempts
```

## Example Interaction

**User**: "Help me create a post from these notes about building the curation feature"

**Response**:
```
Let me analyze your notes and create X content.

[Phase 1: Loads references/x-strategy.md and references/style-guide.md]
[Reads the notes, identifies key insights and specific details]

─────────────────────────────────
📱 Post (Single Tweet, 218 chars)
─────────────────────────────────

Shipped curation v1 for agents.foo today.

Discovery is way harder than app stores. Agents are conversations, not static features.

Had to rebuild around context matching instead of keyword search.

Pattern: "Shipped X, learned Y"
Key specifics: agents.foo, context matching vs keyword search
Engagement: Implicit (landing the insight)

─────────────────────────────────

From your notes, I selected:
✓ Core insight: agent discovery is different
✓ Specific solution: context matching
✓ Concrete detail: agents.foo
✗ Number of rebuild attempts (not essential to the insight)

Would you like me to:
• Save this approved post to .social/ for tracking
• Create a thread version breaking down why search patterns failed
• Add a question ending for more engagement
• Draft additional posts from other insights in your notes
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide context**: "Notes from building curation feature" vs just pasting notes
2. **Mention specific parts**: "Focus on the learning about context matching" helps prioritize
3. **Indicate quantity**: "Create 3 posts from these notes" vs "create posts"
4. **Specify format preference**: "Single tweets only" or "open to threads"
5. **Request variations**: "Show me a few angles" gives options to choose from
6. **Iterate**: After the draft, request adjustments: "Make it more specific" or "Add a question ending"

## Working with Different Note Types

### Technical/Dev Notes
- Extract specific tools, frameworks, or technical decisions
- Focus on the "why" behind technical choices
- Include measurable improvements (time saved, performance gains)

### Personal Observations
- Find the counter-intuitive angle
- Add specific examples from your work
- Tie to practical application

### Meeting Notes
- Extract actionable insights
- Skip procedural details
- Focus on decisions or learnings

### Work Updates
- Lead with what shipped
- Include one key learning
- Make it specific (not "made progress")

## Advanced: Batch Processing

For multiple posts from one set of notes:

1. **Identify 3-5 distinct insights** worth sharing
2. **Create separate posts** for each (don't try to cram everything)
3. **Space them out** - Don't post all at once
4. **Vary patterns** - Use different structures for variety
5. **Test and iterate** - See what resonates, refine approach

## Remember

**Quality over quantity.** 2 valuable posts beat 10 generic ones.

**Specificity is everything.** Names, numbers, tools, projects - these make posts shareable.

**Your voice matters.** Follow the guides but sound like yourself, not a template.

**Value first.** If it doesn't teach, share insight, or help someone - reconsider posting it.
