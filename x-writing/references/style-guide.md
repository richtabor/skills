# X Writing Style Guide

Reference for voice, tone, and structure on X. Keep it direct, specific, and authentic.

---

## Voice & Tone

**Direct, zero fluff.** Get to the point in the first line. No warm-up. No "Hey everyone!"

Start with the insight:
- "Shipped curation today. Discovery is the hard part."
- "Agent conversations can't be described like app features."

**Confident without hedging.** State what you did, learned, or believe. Don't apologize or over-qualify.
- ✓ "Here's what I learned:"
- ✗ "I think I maybe learned something interesting..."

**Personal but focused on work.** Share actual work and learnings, not feelings about work.
- ✓ "Workflow DevKit saves weeks of dev time"
- ✗ "Feeling productive today!"

**Warm skepticism.** Challenge assumptions briefly and specifically.
- "Everyone talks about AI authenticity. Few build quality gates."

---

## Readability & Formatting

Content structure determines whether people read or bounce. Optimize for scanning.

### Visual Structure

**Hook first, always.** First line IS the tweet. No preamble.

Common hooks:
- "How to [X]"
- "Why [X] doesn't work"
- "[X] is [Y]"
- "Shipped [X]"
- "Here's what I learned:"

**One sentence per line.** Creates natural rhythm, easier to process visually.

**Use lists for complexity:**
- Bullet points ("-" or ">") for steps/ideas
- Numbered lists for sequences
- People skim and grab main points

**White space = readability.** Space between lines/sections gives eyes room to rest. Dense text blocks feel exhausting.

### Language Simplification

**Write like a mentor talking to students.**

Choose simple words deliberately—not to dumb down, but to be understood.

**Common simplifications:**
- "use" not "utilize"
- "help" not "facilitate"
- "get better" not "optimize performance"
- "speed up" not "accelerate velocity"

**The 14-year-old test:** If a smart 14-year-old couldn't follow it, simplify more. Stop when it feels almost too simple.

**Goal:** Anyone unfamiliar with your field should understand the core idea.

---

## Sentence-Level Rules

**Short sentences.** 10-15 words max per sentence. Let line breaks create rhythm.

**No italics.** Formatting breaks on X. Use emphasis through word choice: "literally," "actually," "exactly"

**Active, present tense.** What you're doing NOW.
- ✓ "Building"
- ✗ "I built"

**Specific > generic.** Always include numbers, tools, examples:
- ✓ "30 minutes to ship with Claude Code"
- ✗ "Way faster than before"

**Lowercase preference** (when CASING_STYLE="lowercase"):
- Use lowercase for most words, including sentence starts
- ✓ "january '25: showed devs at an @automattic meetup"
- ✗ "January '25: Showed devs at an Automattic meetup"

**Capitalization exceptions** (always capitalize these):
- Personal names: "Rich Tabor", "@riadbenguella"
- WordPress (the brand): "WordPress", not "wordpress"
- Product names: "Claude Code", "Cursor"
- Proper @ mentions: "@automattic" (keep their casing)

**When to use standard casing:**
If you prefer standard capitalization, set CASING_STYLE="standard" in .env.local

## Content Type Structures

### Project Updates (~30%)

What you actually shipped or built.

**Pattern:** What + insight + why it matters

Example:
"Shipped agents.foo curation v1. Discovery is harder than I thought. Apps are static, agents are conversations. Totally different UX problem."

### Learnings (~30%)

Specific discoveries from your work.

**Pattern:** What you learned + specifics + context

Example:
"Workflow DevKit handles durability that would take weeks to build manually. Automatic retries, state persistence, observability built-in. Ships with Next.js."

### Reactions (~25%)

Your take on industry news/discussions.

**Pattern:** What's happening + your specific angle

Example:
"Everyone's talking about Claude 3.5. What excites me: artifact improvements make it better for building agents. Changes the PM workflow completely."

### Insights (~15%)

Broader observations from your work.

**Pattern:** Observation + tension/twist

Example:
"The best products are simple. But getting to simple is incredibly complex. Most teams stop at complicated."

---

## What to Include

**Tools you actually use:** Claude Code, Supabase, Workflow DevKit, WordPress, Linear

**Numbers that prove points:** Time saved, metrics shipped, engagement data

**Real project names:** agents.foo, Big Sky, Foundation Church Q&A (specificity builds credibility)

**Your actual job/role:** "Principal PM at GitHub," "Built Big Sky at Automattic" (use when relevant)

**Genuine surprise:** When something impresses you: "Wild." "Pretty cool." "Honestly surprised."

---

## What to Avoid

### Never say:
- "Game-changer" / "Revolutionary" / "Unlock"
- "Dive in" / "Deep dive"
- "Thoughts?" (too generic)
- "Hot take:" (just state it)
- "Unpopular opinion:" (just state it)
- "Let that sink in"
- "This is the way"
- Excessive emojis (0-1 max, usually 0)
- Corporate speak ("leverage," "synergy," "utilize")
- Vague adjectives without specifics ("amazing," "incredible" without why)

### Don't:
- Hype your own stuff excessively (let work speak)
- Subtweet or be passive-aggressive
- Engage in ratio-bait drama
- Post generic motivational quotes
- Share without adding your angle
- Apologize for posting
- Announce you're "back" or going silent

## Signature Patterns

Common opening patterns:

| Opening | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| "Shipped [X]" | Project updates |
| "Here's what I learned:" | Insight posts |
| "[X] is [Y]" | Direct statements |
| "Wild how..." | Genuine surprise |
| "Most people [X]. But..." | Challenge pattern |
| "How to [X]" | Tutorial/guide posts |

Common closing patterns:

| Closing | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| "More on this soon." | Teaser |
| "What's your approach?" | Question |
| "Pretty cool." | Understated excitement |
| "That's it." | Hard stop |
| No closing | Let the insight land |

---

## Thread Structure

**Each tweet standalone.** Anyone should be able to RT any single tweet and it makes sense.

**No "1/7" numbering.** Just write.

**Structure:**
- **Tweet 1:** Hook with the main insight
- **Tweets 2-N:** Build the argument with specifics
- **Final tweet:** Land it with a question or strong statement

**Max 5 tweets.** If you need more, it's a blog post.

---

## Engagement Tactics

**Ask specific questions.** Not "What do you think?" but "How do you handle agent discovery in your marketplace?"

**Share specifics people can respond to.** Tools, numbers, approaches. Give them something concrete to react to.

**Tease follow-ups.** "More on this soon" or "Writing about this next week" creates anticipation.

**Be generous with knowledge.** Share what you learned. Help people skip the hard parts you hit.

**Don't ask for engagement.** No "RT if you agree" or "Reply with your take." Just make it RT-worthy.

---

## The Formula

For most tweets: **[Specific action/observation] + [Why it matters] + [Your take/learning]**

Examples:

"Shipped curation for agents.foo. Discovery is way harder than app stores. Agents are conversations, not static downloads. Totally different problem."

"Claude Code cut dev time from days to hours. Not because it writes better code. Because it handles the boring parts automatically."

"Everyone wants AI to sound human. Few actually build quality checks. Speed ≠ authenticity."

## Voice Checklist

Before posting, verify:

- [ ] Did I get to the point in line 1?
- [ ] Is this specific? (names, numbers, examples)
- [ ] Would I actually say this out loud?
- [ ] Does it sound like a person, not AI?
- [ ] Did I use any banned phrases? (game-changer, unlock, dive in)
- [ ] If it's a reaction, did I add MY angle?

---

## Examples

**✓ Good:**
"Workflow DevKit is wild. Built-in durability, automatic retries, state persistence. Ships with Next.js. Would take weeks to build manually."

Why: Specific tools, concrete benefits, genuine reaction, personal experience

**✓ Good:**
"Shipped agents.foo curation v1 today. Discovery is the hardest part. Agents aren't apps—they're conversations. Traditional app store UX doesn't work here."

Why: Real project, specific insight, clear problem statement

**✗ Bad:**
"Just shipped something cool! Really excited about this game-changing feature. It's going to revolutionize how we think about discovery. Thoughts?"

Why: Vague, banned phrases, generic closing, no specifics

**✗ Bad:**
"Hot take: AI is the future of product development. We need to leverage these tools to unlock new possibilities. What do you think?"

Why: Empty statement, corporate speak, no personal experience, generic question
