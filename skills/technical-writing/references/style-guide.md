# Style Guide

A reference for capturing a distinctive voice across blog posts, essays, and professional writing.

---

## Voice & Tone

**Conversational authority.** Write like you're talking to a smart friend—confident but not preachy. State opinions directly without hedging excessively. When you believe something, say it: *"That's not me."* or *"That's just how it works."*

**Warm skepticism.** Challenge conventional wisdom constructively. Reframe problems rather than just criticizing them. Example: *"Most people treat focus like a skill to master… But that misses the fundamental truth."*

**First-person grounding.** Anchor ideas in personal experience before expanding to broader principles. *"I used to kill ideas before they had a real chance."* leads to a larger point about curiosity.

---

## Structure

**Hook with a twist or question.** Openings often subvert expectations or pose something worth thinking about:

- *"Focus isn't what you think it is."*
- *"What if Matt had joined Google instead of starting WordPress?"*
- *"You know what I mean by vibe coding?"*

**Short paragraphs.** Rarely more than 3-4 sentences. Often just one or two. White space is part of the rhythm.

**End with punch.** Closings are declarative, sometimes a single line that lands:

- *"So yea, I don't vibe code."*
- *"Everything else is noise."*
- *"Fail often. Fail fast."*
- *"That's all."*

**Internal linking.** Weave references to previous posts naturally, building a connected body of work: *"Find something that matters to you"* links to related content.

## Titles

**Casing:** Use sentence case (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns). Title case feels more formal/traditional—fine for enterprise blogs or publications, but doesn't match your voice or the conversational tone of first-person narrative posts. Sentence case reads more naturally and is what most tech blogs are moving toward.

- ✅ *"Why I stopped using feature flags"*
- ✅ *"I changed my mind about React Server Components"*
- ❌ *"Why I Stopped Using Feature Flags"* (too formal)
- ❌ *"I Changed My Mind About React Server Components"* (too formal)

**Note:** This can be configured via `TITLE_CASE_STYLE` environment variable (defaults to "sentence" if not set).

**What to lead with:** Choose one:

- **Tension or insight** → *"Why I stopped using feature flags"*
- **Topic only** → *"Thoughts on feature flags"* (usually weaker)

**Specificity level:** Pick based on your content:

- **Specific with numbers/details** → *"How we cut build times from 12 minutes to 45 seconds"*
- **Vague/generic** → *"Improving build performance"* (feels like clickbait)

**Tone matching:** Match your title style to your post type:

- **Reflective piece** → contemplative, personal title
- **Tactical how-to** → direct, action-oriented title
- **Philosophical essay** → thoughtful, open-ended title

**Formula check:** Avoid these patterns (unless you have a specific reason):

- "The ultimate guide to X"
- "X is dead"
- "Everything you need to know about X"

**Conversation test:** Would you actually say this to someone?

- ✅ *"I changed my mind about React Server Components"*
- ❌ *"A paradigm shift in my React Server Components journey"*

**Length decision:**

- **Shorter** (usually better, but clarity first)
- **Longer** (if short version is confusing)

**Wordplay choice:**

- **Skip it** (unless it genuinely lands)
- **Use it** (only if pun/double meaning adds value, not confusion)

**Final check:** The title is a promise—does the post deliver on it?

## Sentence-Level

**Italics for emphasis and internal voice.** *"Is this worth my time?"* or *"technically"* when calling out a word.

**Sentence rhythm and flow.** Vary sentence length. Follow a short sentence with a longer one. Let ideas breathe. Connect related thoughts with dashes, semicolons, or conjunctions instead of hard stops: *"This does X. It also does Y."* → *"This does X—and it also does Y."* Avoid sequences of 3+ sentences that are roughly the same length. Read it aloud; if it sounds like a list, it probably is. Not every thought needs its own sentence. When two ideas are tightly linked, keep them together. Reserve short, punchy sentences for emphasis—not as the default cadence.

**Active voice, present tense.** Write about what *is*, not what *was* or *could be*. Even when reflecting on the past, bring it into the present: *"Something felt different."*

---

## Content Patterns

**Show the build, then the insight.** Walk through a process or experience before extracting the lesson. The reader discovers alongside you.

**Ask questions to the reader.** Close posts with genuine invitations: *"What about you?"* or *"Have you created any subagents lately that you've found interesting?"*

**Concrete before abstract.** Specific tools, numbers, examples come first. Then zoom out: *"Thirty minutes… Even just a few months ago, this was a nights and weekends endeavor."*

**Bold claims with personal stakes.** Don't write detached analysis. Have skin in the game and make that clear.

---

## Formatting

**Minimal headers in short posts.** For essays under 500 words, let the prose flow without section breaks.

**Heading casing:** Use sentence case for all headings (H2, H3, etc.) to match the conversational tone. Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.

- ✅ *"How we built it"*
- ✅ *"The technical details"*
- ❌ *"How We Built It"* (too formal)
- ❌ *"The Technical Details"* (too formal)

**Note:** This can be configured via `HEADING_CASE_STYLE` environment variable (defaults to "sentence" if not set).

**Bold for key phrases in advice posts.** When listing principles, bold the main point then explain it.

**Blockquotes for external voices.** When citing others, pull the quote, then respond to it.

**Links as texture, not interruption.** Hyperlink key concepts to related posts or sources without breaking reading flow.

---

## What to Avoid

- Jargon for its own sake
- Excessive hedging (*"I think maybe perhaps…"*)
- Long introductions before getting to the point
- Explaining things already written about (link instead)
- Corporate-speak or buzzwords
- Unnecessary throat-clearing
