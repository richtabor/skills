# AI Writing Patterns to Avoid

A guide for writing content that reads as natural and human rather than AI-generated. These patterns are organized into five categories: Language, Tone, Flow, Patterns, and Document Structure.

---

## Language

Vocabulary and word choice are the most reliable indicators of AI-generated content.

### High-Certainty AI Words

These words are strong indicators of AI writing. Avoid them entirely:

- delve, delves, delving
- showcasing
- underscore, underscores, underscoring
- intricate, intricacies
- meticulous, meticulously
- commendable
- realm
- pivotal
- noteworthy
- versatile
- robust
- seamless, seamlessly
- invaluable
- groundbreaking
- multifaceted
- bespoke
- unprecedented
- transformative

### Overused Abstract Nouns

Replace these with concrete, specific alternatives:

- journey
- tapestry
- landscape
- beacon
- endeavor
- testament
- symphony
- kaleidoscope
- interplay
- nuance
- facet
- prowess
- treasure trove

### Overused Abstract Verbs

Choose simpler, more direct verbs:

- embark
- illuminate
- harness
- foster, fostering
- navigate
- leverage
- unravel
- transcend
- resonate
- catalyze
- unleash
- unlock
- elevate

### Excessive Adverbs

Cut these intensifiers; they weaken your writing:

- profoundly
- remarkably
- notably
- crucially
- innovatively
- methodically
- tirelessly

## Tone

Voice markers that distinguish human from AI writing.

### Hedging Language

AI tends to over-qualify statements. Be direct instead of using:

- may, might, could
- possibly, potentially
- likely
- "it is likely that"
- "there is a possibility that"
- "research suggests"
- "studies show"

### Qualifiers and Intensifiers

Cut or minimize these filler words:

- very
- quite
- rather
- somewhat
- extremely
- particularly
- fairly
- highly
- significantly
- absolutely
- completely

### Use Contractions

Natural writing includes contractions. Use them freely:

- don't, can't, won't
- isn't, aren't, wasn't, weren't
- haven't, hasn't, hadn't
- shouldn't, wouldn't, couldn't
- we'll, we're, you're, they're
- I'm, it's, that's
- there's, here's, what's, who's
- let's

---

## Flow

Transitions and sentence patterns that signal AI writing.

### Formal Transitions to Avoid

These feel stiff and over-structured:

- furthermore
- moreover
- additionally
- "it's important to note that"
- "it's worth mentioning that"
- "it's worth noting"
- "that being said"
- "with this in mind"
- firstly, secondly, thirdly, lastly

### Generic AI Phrases

Cliches that AI overuses:

- "at the end of the day"
- "dive into"
- "let's unpack"
- "game-changer"
- "cutting-edge"
- "plays a vital role"
- "plays a crucial role"
- "stands as"
- "serves as"

### Structural Patterns to Fix

**Em-dash overuse**: Replace em dashes (—) with commas, periods, or parentheses.

**-ing phrase endings**: Avoid trailing participial phrases like:

- "...ensuring success"
- "...highlighting growth"
- "...showcasing excellence"
- "...fostering innovation"

**"Not only...but also"**: Rewrite these parallelisms more naturally.

**Dual adjective constructions**: Avoid phrases like "innovative and comprehensive approach" or "dynamic and robust solution."

**Reframing cliches**: Don't use the "It's not X, it's Y" pattern.

## Patterns

Statistical patterns in sentence and paragraph structure.

### Sentence Length Variety

AI writing tends to have uniform sentence lengths. Fix this by:

- Mixing short punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones
- Varying sentence structure throughout
- Avoiding the same rhythm paragraph after paragraph
- Targeting a standard deviation of 10+ words in sentence length

### Paragraph Length Variety

- Some paragraphs should be short (2-3 sentences)
- Others can be longer and more developed
- Avoid all paragraphs being the same approximate length
- Don't start consecutive sentences the same way

---

## Document Structure

Document-level patterns that indicate AI generation.

### Opening Cliches

Never start with:

- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "In today's digital world"
- "In today's rapidly evolving world"
- "In the ever-evolving landscape"
- "In the dynamic landscape"
- "In the realm of"
- "Have you ever wondered"
- "Picture this"
- "Let's delve into"
- "As we embark on this journey"

### Closing Cliches

Never end with:

- "In conclusion"
- "In summary"
- "To summarize"
- "The possibilities are endless"
- "Only time will tell"
- "Looking ahead"

### Conclusion Length

Keep conclusions proportionate. If your conclusion is more than 15-20% of the total document, it's likely too long and summary-heavy (a common AI pattern).

## Summary

Write like you're explaining to a smart friend, not presenting to a committee:

1. **Be direct**: Cut hedging and qualifiers
2. **Be specific**: Replace abstract words with concrete ones
3. **Be natural**: Use contractions and varied sentence structures
4. **Be original**: Avoid cliched openings, closings, and transitions
5. **Be varied**: Mix up sentence and paragraph lengths
