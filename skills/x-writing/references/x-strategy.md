# X Content Strategy

Reference for creating X content that builds audience and generates business. Focus on high-value, consistent posting.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Volume + Value = Growth**

Post consistently (3+ times daily) with genuinely valuable content. Not everything will perform—even great insights flop due to writing or algorithm. Success comes from consistency and helping people solve real problems.

**The goal:** Build an audience that respects your ideas, not just follower count. When people stop scrolling because they recognize your name, you've won.

## Three Pillars of Effective Content

Every post needs all three. Miss one and it likely flops.

### 1. Genuinely Valuable

**Fresh insights from real experience**, not recycled advice said a thousand times.

- Pull from your actual work and discoveries
- Share what surprised you or changed your approach
- Contradict common assumptions with specifics
- Help people skip mistakes you made

**Test:** Would I bookmark this if someone else wrote it?

**Examples:**
- ✓ "Agent discovery is fundamentally different from app discovery. Apps are static—you search features. Agents are conversations—you can't describe all possible conversations."
- ✗ "Discovery is important for products"

**Specificity builds credibility:**
- ✓ "Claude Code cut deployment time from 4 hours to 20 minutes"
- ✗ "This tool is amazing"

**Note:** Shitposting rarely works. A few people do it well, but most fail when they try.

### 2. Immediately Actionable

**Give people a system they can implement today.**

Pure observation gets views. Teaching implementation gets followers and business.

- Don't just point at something, show how to use it
- Walk through the actual process step-by-step
- Make it immediately applicable to their workflow

**Examples:**
- ✗ "The new ChatGPT update is incredible"
- ✓ "How to write copy that sounds human with GPT-4.5: [step-by-step process]"

Tweets become your portfolio. Consistent how-to content proves expertise and leads to business naturally.

### 3. Sparks Natural Engagement

**Never beg for engagement.** Structure content so bookmarks and replies happen organically.

#### Trigger Bookmarks:

Use hooks that signal immediate value:
- "How to [solve problem]"
- "Here's what I learned [doing X]"
- "Do this before [common action]"

People on autopilot bookmark useful-looking content instantly.

#### Drive Replies:

**Option A: Strong opinion**
- Make a specific, controversial claim
- People argue or support—both drive engagement
- Example: "GPT-4.5 writes better copy than Claude, Gemini, and Grok combined"

**Option B: Collaborative invitation**
- Leave room for others to share their approach
- Feels inclusive, gets experience-sharing
- Example: "This is my workflow with ChatGPT—curious if anyone's tested this with Claude"

## Content Selection Framework

### High Priority → Always Share

**Shipped work + learnings**
- What you built (specific)
- One key insight from building it
- Why it matters

**Non-obvious insights**
- What surprised you
- Why it contradicts expectations
- How it changes your approach

**Tool recommendations**
- What it does
- Specific benefit (numbers, time saved)
- Real example from your use
- Only share tools you actually use

**Solutions to common problems**
- The specific problem
- Why obvious solutions failed
- What actually worked
- The key insight

**Counter-intuitive patterns**
- The observation
- Why it's unexpected
- Practical implications

### Medium Priority → Consider

**Industry takes with unique angle**
- Your specific perspective from real work
- Why it matters
- Concrete evidence

Avoid: "AI is changing everything" (generic)
Do: "Everyone talks about AI speed. What matters: maintaining voice at scale."

**Process improvements**
- Must include concrete examples and outcomes

**Technical decisions**
- Share the context and reasoning

**Genuine questions**
- Ask about specific approaches, not vague "thoughts?"

### Skip These

**Low Priority:**
- Progress updates without insights
- Plans before execution (share when shipped)
- Obvious observations
- Feelings about work without value
- Meta-posting about posting

**Never Share:**
- Engagement bait ("RT if you agree")
- Generic motivation ("Never give up!")
- Vague hype without specifics
- Complaints without solutions
- Announcements of announcements

**Red flags in notes:**
If you see these phrases, usually skip:
- "Just wanted to share..."
- "Random thought..."
- "Does anyone else..."
- "Feeling grateful..."

## High-Engagement Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Shipped X, Learned Y"

Combine progress with insight.

**Structure:**
- What you shipped (specific)
- Key learning
- Why it matters

**Example:**
"Shipped curation v1 for agents.foo.

Traditional search patterns fail for agents—they're conversations, not feature lists.

Rebuilt discovery around context matching instead."

### Pattern 2: "Here's What I Learned"

Share non-obvious insights.

**Structure:**
- State the learning directly
- Brief context
- Why it's counter-intuitive
- How you're applying it

**Example:**
"Agent discovery is fundamentally different from app discovery.

Apps are static—search features, read descriptions, install.

Agents are conversations. You can't describe all possible conversations.

The UX isn't search. It's contextual matching."

### Pattern 3: "How to Do X"

Step-by-step tactical content. Highly bookmarkable.

**Structure:**
- "How to [solve specific problem]"
- Clear steps (bulleted or numbered)
- Why this approach works
- Optional: Engagement question

**Example:**
"How to maintain voice at scale with AI:

- Set up quality gates before shipping
- Use custom style guides, not generic prompts
- Review first 50 outputs manually to tune
- Monitor consistency metrics weekly

Speed means nothing if your voice disappears."

### Pattern 4: Problem → Solution

Show how you solved something specific.

**Structure:**
- The specific problem
- Why obvious solutions failed
- What actually worked
- Key insight

**Example:**
"Problem: Can't describe agent conversations like app features.

First try: Traditional search. Failed—keywords don't capture conversational capability.

What worked: Context matching based on what the agent does in conversation.

Discovery UX follows the product paradigm."

### Pattern 5: Specific vs Generic

Challenge vague industry wisdom.

**Structure:**
- Common wisdom (vague)
- Specific reality from your work
- Why the difference matters

**Example:**
"Everyone says AI should sound human.

But 'human' is vague. What actually matters: consistent voice, clear reasoning, genuine personality.

Most tools optimize for speed over authenticity."

### Pattern 6: Tool Recommendation

Share tools that measurably helped.

**Structure:**
- Tool name
- Specific benefit (numbers/time)
- What it handles you'd otherwise build
- Real use case

**Example:**
"Workflow DevKit handles agent durability automatically.

Built-in retries, state persistence, observability. Would take weeks to build.

Using it for all agents.foo workflows. Saved ~3 weeks dev time."

## Thread Strategy

### When to Thread (2-5 tweets)

- Narrative with steps ("How we built X")
- Multiple related insights ("3 learnings about X")
- Before/after story ("Tried X, failed, here's what worked")

### When to Use Single Tweets

- One clear insight
- Quick updates
- Strong observations
- Tool recommendations

**Default to single tweets.** Only thread when the story requires it.

### Thread Structure

- **Tweet 1:** Hook with main insight (most important)
- **Tweets 2-4:** Build with specifics, examples, details
- **Final tweet:** Land with question or strong statement

**Each tweet must work standalone.** People should be able to RT any tweet and it makes sense.

**No numbering.** No "1/5" markers.

**Max 5 tweets.** Longer = blog post territory.

---

## What Makes Content Shareable

**People RT:**
- Specificity (concrete details vs vague claims)
- Insights (non-obvious learnings)
- Utility (actionable knowledge)
- Relatability (shared struggles + specific solutions)

**People Reply When You:**
- Ask specific questions (not "what do you think?")
- Make specific, debatable claims
- Show genuine curiosity
- Leave room for others to add their perspective

---

## Recognizable Style Development

Generic content blends together. Distinctive style makes people stop scrolling.

**Your style = your signature**

Develop 3-4 structural patterns that feel natural:
- Specific opening phrases
- Consistent formatting (like using ">" for lists)
- Particular ways you emphasize points
- Phrases you use before certain types of takes

**Consistency without formula.** Patterns should be recognizable but not templated.

Examples:
- Always using ">" to break down processes
- Starting tool recs with "X handles Y automatically"
- Using "tbh" or "honestly" before controversial takes
- Writing in fragments for emphasis
